Title: Look for patterns in my friends' usage of Facebook Chat
Description: I find that I go on Facebook more when I'm more lonely.
    (Unfortunately, it usually doesn't help.) I wonder whether other
    people do the same. Moreover, it might be interesting to see when
    people break their typical Facebook usage patterns.
